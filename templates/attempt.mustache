    @template quizaccess_announcements/container

    Announcement container that appears at top of quiz.
    
    ids for JS:
    * QuizAnnouncements_container

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * data-noannouncements

    Context variables required for this template:
    * header HTML to display above any announcements
    * announcements HTML of the current announcements or false or empty to display the no announcement message.

    As they may be needed twice, announcements are pre-processed by another template and passed to this as raw HTML
    JS is loaded elsewhere as this cannot be directly output. This also means uniqueids can't be used.
    Example context (json):
    {
        "header": "<h3>Announcements</h3>",
        "announcements": "see announcement template for example."
    }
}}
<div class="quizaccess_announcements_attempt">
    {{{header}}}
    <div id="QuizAnnouncements_container">{{{announcements}}}
    {{^announcements}}
        <div data-noannouncements="true">{{#str}}no_announcements, quizaccess_announcements{{/str}}</div>
    {{/announcements}}
    </div>
</div>
